# Chrome Extension - Page Currency Converter 

Finds currency amounts in pages and converts them to a given currency. 

## Created with: 

My starter kit for Chrome extension projects, based on React, MobX, CSS Modules and TypeScript.

It provides a skeleton content script, popup page, options page and a background page.
Updates to the build will refresh the extension and page extension is live on. 

This kit consists of the latest versions of:
* React
* Webpack
* MobX
* SCSS
* CSS Modules
* TypeScript

#### Build Instructions

`yarn build`

#### Development Mode

`yarn install`

`yarn watch`

The extension asset files are created at `/build/`.
Load "unpacked extension" in Chrome to test it out!

Changes to files will trigger the extension and page to reload.
